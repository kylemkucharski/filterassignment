    <p>From the jazz clubs of Harlem to the punk rock mecca of CBGB’s on the Bowery, New York City has always been married to music. But with rising rents and high demand, several of the city’s smaller music venues have rapidly disappeared in the last two
      decades. <br><br>In a comprehensive report conducted by the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, it was revealed that 20 percent of New York’s smaller venues have closed in the past 15 years. Since then, the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment,
      along with the Department of Cultural Affairs and New York City Council Members have mounted efforts to save its underground venues and smaller spaces by creating an Office Of Nightlife and launching CreateNYC, New York’s first-ever cultural plan.<br><br>      In March, the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment announced that former club owner Ariel Palitz would be New York’s first-ever Night Mayor. The role is designed to serve as a liaison between venues, residents, city officials and law enforcement.
      Janet Allon of the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment said that the city hopes these recent efforts by the city will help bolster New York’s smaller venues that hold 500 people or less. “Small music venues are incubators of talent, and are
      places where up-and-coming musicians and other performers can hone their craft,” said Allon.

    <p>Allon noted that New York’s smaller venues often operate as much more than a place to see music.<br><br> “Small venues are also grassroots cultural places where diverse communities can come together to have fun,” said Allon. “They are a vital part
      of New York City’s music ecosystem and economy.”
